# Galaxies Data
## Introduction
The galaxies data contains 80 variables that characterise the demographic and socio-economic situation in 181 galaxies over a period of at most 26 years. The data consists of two sets of data: train and validation datasets.
## Objectives
In determining what makes the galaxies better off, we’d like to determine:
# 
• Variables which best explain the variance of the well-being index
#
• The future well-being values of the galaxies
## Analysis
In my analysis of the train data, I used R programming to determine the determinants of the galaxies’ well-being i.e. a positive and negative correlation between the variables and wellbeing index or no correlation. Further, through the visualisation, I determine the type of frequency distribution curve the determinants exhibited i.e. normal distribution, right skewed and left skewed.
The following variables exhibited a positive correlation with respect to the wellbeing index:
# 
• Income Index.
#
• Education Index.
#
• Population, Urban (%).
#
• Existence expectancy at birth.
#
• Gross income per capita.
#
• Intergalactic Development Index (IDI).
#
• Population using at least basic drinking water services (%).
#
•Population using at least basic sanitation services (%).

The following variables exhibited a negative correlation with respect to the wellbeing index:
#
• Unemployment, total (% of labour force).
#
• Natural resource depletion.
#
• Intergalactic Development Index (IDI), Rank

Some of the variables that exhibited zero correlation with respect to the wellbeing index include:
# 
• Gross Capital Formation.
# 
• Galactic Year.
